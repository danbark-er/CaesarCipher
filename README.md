My first Python script :)

The Caesar cipher is a simple and ancient encryption method that involves shifting letters in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Each letter in the plaintext is replaced by another letter or symbol that is a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, if the key is 3, A is replaced by D, B is replaced by E, and so on. 

To decrypt the message, the receiver applies the same number of shifts in the opposite direction.
